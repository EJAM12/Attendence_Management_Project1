For our IS147 Group Project, we decided to tackle the concept of configuring an attendance management system due to the fact that it would be an engaging coding idea that would help enrich our overarching java skills. The issue we would be addressing is that trying to keep track of a myriad of students attending a certain course can be a difficult and laborious task. Our program will help combat this issue because it will help make the task much more accessible and easier to manage. We will create multiple classes that will communicate with each other in order to properly assign attendance. The classes will also have separate attributes/objects such as name, age, and gender in order to help us properly quantify their differences from each other. The function of the program is that it would help teachers and professors alike keep track of the attendance of individual students over a long period of time.
